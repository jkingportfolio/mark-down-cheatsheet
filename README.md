## Headers
Headers in Markdown are used to create different levels of headings. They are essential for organizing your content and providing a hierarchy to your text.

To create headers, you can use one to six hash symbols (#) at the beginning of a line, followed by a space and the header text. The number of hash symbols determines the header level. Here are some examples:

``` md
# Heading Level 1

## Heading Level 2

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

###### Heading Level 6
```

Explanation:

``` md
`#` Heading Level 1: This creates a top-level heading (Heading Level 1).
`##` Heading Level 2: This creates a second-level heading (Heading Level 2).
`###` Heading Level 3: This creates a third-level heading (Heading Level 3).
`####` Heading Level 4: This creates a fourth-level heading (Heading Level 4).
`#####` Heading Level 5: This creates a fifth-level heading (Heading Level 5).
`######` Heading Level 6: This creates a sixth-level heading (Heading Level 6).
```
Headers are often used to structure your document, and they also influence the table of contents if you generate one for your Markdown file. Additionally, some Markdown editors and platforms use headers to determine the hierarchy of your content for better navigation and organization.

Remember to add a blank line between the header and the content below it to improve readability and avoid unintended formatting issues.

## Emphasis and Bold

In Markdown, you can apply emphasis and make text bold to highlight important parts of your content.

### Emphasis

To emphasize text, you can use either asterisks (*) or underscores (_) around the text you want to emphasize. Using a single asterisk or underscore will render the text in italics, and using double asterisks or underscores will render the text in bold.

``` md
*This text will be in italics using asterisks.*
_This text will also be in italics using underscores._

**This text will be bold using double asterisks.**
__This text will also be bold using double underscores.__
```

Explanation:

*This text will be in italics using asterisks.*: This text will be displayed in italics.

_This text will also be in italics using underscores._: This text will also be displayed in italics.

**This text will be bold using double asterisks.**: This text will be displayed in bold.

__This text will also be bold using double underscores.__: This text will also be displayed in bold.

You can use emphasis to make certain words or phrases stand out and provide visual cues to readers. Italicized text is often used for emphasis or to indicate book titles, while bold text is commonly used for headings, important points, or highlighting key information.

Remember that it's important to be consistent in your use of emphasis and bold throughout your document to maintain a clear and professional look.


## Lists

Lists in Markdown allow you to organize items in a structured manner. There are two main types of lists: unordered lists and ordered lists.

   - ### Unordered Lists
   Unordered lists are used to create bullet-point lists. To create an unordered list, you can use asterisks (*), dashes (-), or plus signs (+) followed by a space and the list item.

   Example:

   ``` md
   * Item 1
   * Item 2
   * Item 3
   ```

   Explanation:
   
   * Item 1: This creates the first item in the unordered list.
   * Item 2: This creates the second item in the unordered list.
   * Item 3: This creates the third item in the unordered list.

   - ### Ordered Lists
   Ordered lists are used to create numbered lists. To create an ordered list, you can use numbers followed by a period (.) and a space, along with the list item.

   Example:

   ``` md
   1. First item
   2. Second item
   3. Third item
  ```

  Explanation:
  
   1. First item: This creates the first item in the ordered list.
   2. Second item: This creates the second item in the ordered list.
   3. Third item: This creates the third item in the ordered list.
   The above example will render as:

   First item
   Second item
   Third item

   - ### Nested Lists
   You can also create nested lists in Markdown by indenting the items under a parent list item. Nested lists can be either unordered or ordered.

   Example:

   ``` md
   * Main item
     * Sub-item 1
     * Sub-item 2
   * Another main item
     1. Sub-item A
     2. Sub-item B
  ```

   Explanation:
   
   `* Main item`: This creates the first main item in the outer unordered list.
   `* Sub-item 1`: This creates a sub-item under the first main item.
   `* Sub-item 2`: This creates another sub-item under the first main item.
   `* Another main item`: This creates the second main item in the outer unordered list.
   `1. Sub-item A`: This creates a sub-item under the second main item in the ordered nested list.
   `2. Sub-item B`: This creates another sub-item under the second main item in the ordered nested list.
     
   The above example will render as:

   Main item
     Sub-item 1
     Sub-item 2
   Another main item
     Sub-item A
     Sub-item B

Nested lists are useful when you need to create a hierarchy of information or break down complex points into sub-points. Remember to indent the sub-items to the appropriate level to ensure they are nested correctly.


## Links
Links in Markdown allow you to create clickable references to other web pages, files, or email addresses. There are three main types of links: inline links, reference links, and URLs/email addresses.

   - ### Inline Links
   Inline links are created by enclosing the link text in square brackets [ ] followed by the actual URL or link destination in parentheses ( ).

   Example:

   ``` md
   This is an [example inline link](https://www.example.com).
   ```

  Explanation:
  
  `This is an`: This is the regular text.
  `[example inline link]`: This is the link text displayed to the user.
  `(https://www.example.com)`: This is the URL or link destination that the link points to.
  When rendered, the above example will appear as:
  
  This is an [example inline link](https://www.example.com).

   - ### Reference Links
  Reference links are useful for maintaining clean and readable Markdown documents, especially when you have multiple links to the same URL. You define the link reference at the bottom of the document, and then you can refer to that reference throughout the text using square brackets [ ].

   Example:

   ``` md
   This is a [reference link][example_link].
   ...
   ...
   [example_link]: https://www.example.com
   ```

   Explanation:
   
   `This is a`: This is the regular text. <br>
   `[reference link]`: This is the link reference that will be replaced with the actual link text. <br>
   `[example_link]`: https://www.example.com: This is the link reference definition at the bottom of the document, associating [example_link] with the URL https://www.example.com. <br>
   
   When rendered, the above example will appear as:

   This is a [reference link][example_link]. <br>
   ... <br>
   ... <br>  
   And the reference link at the bottom of the document will create the actual link: <br>
   
   [example_link]: https://www.example.com
   
   - ### URLs and Email Addresses
   You can also directly include URLs and email addresses in your Markdown document, and they will automatically become clickable links.

   Example:

   ``` md
   For more information, visit: <https://www.example.com>

   To contact us, send an email to: <info@example.com>
   ```

   Explanation:
For more information, visit:: This is the regular text.

<https://www.example.com>: This is the URL, and it will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

To contact us, send an email to:: This is the regular text.

<info@example.com>: This is the email address, and it will be automatically converted into a clickable link for composing emails.

When rendered, the above example will appear as:

For more information, visit: https://www.example.com

To contact us, send an email to: info@example.com

Links are essential for providing additional resources or contact information within your document. Always make sure to use descriptive link text that conveys the purpose of the link to the readers.




## Images
In Markdown, you can include images in your document to make it visually engaging and informative. To add an image, you use an exclamation mark (!) followed by the alt text in square brackets [ ], and then the URL or path to the image file in parentheses ( ).

``` md
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

Explanation:
`![Alt Text]`: This is the alt text for the image, which is displayed if the image fails to load. It also serves as important accessibility information for visually impaired users.

`(https://example.com/image.jpg)`: This is the URL or path to the image file. Make sure to replace this with the actual URL or relative path to your image.

When rendered, the above example will display the image with the specified alt text:

INSERT IMAGE LINK TO REPO FOR EXAMPLE


Local Images
If the image is stored locally (i.e., within the same repository or directory as the Markdown file), you can use a relative path instead of a URL.

Example:

``` md
![Local Image](images/local-image.jpg)
```

Explanation:
`![Local Image]`: This is the alt text for the local image.
`(images/local-image.jpg)`: This is the relative path to the local image file. Make sure to replace this with the correct path to your local image.
When rendered, the above example will display the local image with the specified alt text:

INSERT IMAGE TO REPO FOR EXAMPLE LOCAL IMAGE

Image Size
You can also specify the size of the image using HTML attributes width and height within the image tag.

Example:
``` md
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="200">
```

Explanation:
`<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg">`: This is the image tag, specifying the image URL.
`alt="Alt Text"`: This is the alt text for the image.
`width="400" height="200"`: These are HTML attributes defining the width and height of the image in pixels.
When rendered, the above example will display the image with the specified dimensions:

<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="200">

Images add visual appeal to your content and are especially useful for documentation, tutorials, and showcasing visual examples. Remember to use descriptive alt text to provide context for the image and improve accessibility for all users.



## Blockquotes
Blockquotes are used to display quoted text or excerpts from external sources in a visually distinct and indented format.

Example:

``` md
> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
> Blockquotes are commonly used to highlight important information or quotes from other sources.
```

Explanation: <br>

`>`: The greater-than symbol (>) is used to create a blockquote.
Each line starting with > will be part of the same blockquote.
When rendered, the above example will appear as:

> This is a blockquote. <br>
> It can span multiple lines. <br>
> Blockquotes are commonly used to highlight important information or quotes from other sources. <br>



## Code Blocks
Code blocks in Markdown allow you to display blocks of code or snippets of programming language in a visually distinct and formatted way.

   - ### Inline Code
   To include short snippets of code within a sentence or paragraph, you can use backticks (`) to enclose the code.

   Example:

   ``` md
   You can use the backtick to highlight `inline code` within a sentence.
   ```

   Explanation:

   The backticks (`) around inline code indicate that it should be displayed as code within the sentence.
   When rendered, the above example will appear as:

   You can use the backtick to highlight inline code within a sentence.

   - ### Fenced Code Blocks
   For larger code blocks or multiple lines of code, you can use fenced code blocks. Fenced code blocks are created by enclosing the code with three backticks `(```)` on a separate line before and after the code block. You can also specify the programming language after the opening three backticks to enable syntax highlighting.

   Example:

   ``` python
  def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  greet("Alice")
  ```


   - ### Syntax Highlighting
   Markdown editors and platforms that support syntax highlighting will color-code the code within fenced code blocks to improve readability. The specific language specified after the opening three backticks (```) tells the renderer which syntax rules to apply for highlighting.

Keep in mind that not all Markdown editors or platforms support syntax highlighting. However, when used in supported environments, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting can greatly enhance the presentation of code in your Markdown documents.



## Horizontal Rule
Horizontal rules, also known as horizontal lines or dividers, are used to visually separate sections of content within a Markdown document. They can help improve readability and organization.

Example:


``` md
Content above the horizontal rule.

---

Content below the horizontal rule.
```

Explanation:
`---`: Three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores placed on a separate line create a horizontal rule.
When rendered, the above example will appear as:

Content above the horizontal rule.

---

Content below the horizontal rule.


### Styling Horizontal Rules
You can use three or more hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) to create a horizontal rule. All three options render as a horizontal line with the same appearance.

Example:

``` md
Content above the horizontal rule.

***

Content below the horizontal rule.
```

Explanation:
`***` Three asterisks on a separate line create a horizontal rule.
When rendered, the above example will appear as:

Content above the horizontal rule.

***

Content below the horizontal rule.

Horizontal rules are especially useful when you want to create clear visual breaks between sections of content, such as different topics or chapters in a document. They help readers quickly identify transitions and separate distinct parts of your document.

## Line Breaks
In Markdown, a single line break within a paragraph does not create a visible break in the rendered output. To insert a new line or a line break, you need to use the appropriate Markdown syntax.

Example:

``` md
This is the first line of the paragraph.  
This is the second line of the paragraph.
```

Explanation:

The space before the double space at the end of the first line indicates a line break.
When rendered, the above example will appear as:

This is the first line of the paragraph.
This is the second line of the paragraph.


Line Break with <br>

Alternatively, you can use the HTML <br> tag to force a line break within a paragraph.

Example:

``` md
This is the first line of the paragraph.<br>
This is the second line of the paragraph.
```

Explanation:

`<br>`: The `<br>` tag is used to create a line break.
When rendered, the above example will appear as:

This is the first line of the paragraph.<br>
This is the second line of the paragraph.

Using the space at the end of a line or the `<br>` tag allows you to add line breaks in places where you want to control the layout or formatting, such as in poems, addresses, or other text with specific line breaks. Keep in mind that excessive use of <br> tags can negatively impact the accessibility and maintainability of your Markdown document, so use them judiciously.

## Tables
Markdown allows you to create simple tables to display tabular data. Tables consist of columns and rows, and you can use pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to create the header row.

   - ### Basic Tables
   To create a basic table, use pipes to separate the columns and hyphens to define the header row.
   ``` md
   | Name       | Age | Gender |
   |------------|-----|--------|
   | John       | 30  | Male   |
   | Emily      | 25  | Female |
   | Michael    | 35  | Male   |
   ```

   Explanation:
   
   Each row is separated by a new line. <br>
   Columns within each row are separated by pipes (|). <br>
   The first row, separated by hyphens (-), defines the header row. <br>
   When rendered, the above example will appear as: <br>

   | Name       | Age | Gender |
   |------------|-----|--------|
   | John       | 30  | Male   |
   | Emily      | 25  | Female |
   | Michael    | 35  | Male   |

   - ### Alignment and Formatting
   You can align the content within the columns by adding colons (:) to the hyphens in the header row. A colon at the left of the hyphen indicates left alignment, a colon at the right indicates right alignment, and colons on both sides indicate centered alignment.

   Example:

   ``` md
   | Name       | Age | Gender   |
   |:----------:|:---:|:-------:|
   | John       | 30  | Male     |
   | Emily      | 25  | Female   |
   | Michael    | 35  | Male     |
   ```

   Explanation:
   
   `:----------:`: The colons on both sides of the hyphens indicate centered alignment for the "Name" column. <br>
   `:---:`: The colons on both sides of the hyphens indicate centered alignment for the "Age" column. <br>
   `:-------:`: The colons on both sides of the hyphens indicate centered alignment for the "Gender" column. <br>
   When rendered, the above example will appear as: <br>

   | Name       | Age | Gender   |
   |:----------:|:---:|:-------:|
   | John       | 30  | Male     |
   | Emily      | 25  | Female   |
   | Michael    | 35  | Male     |

   - ### Spanning Cells
   You can also create cells that span multiple rows or columns using the pipe symbol (|) with hyphens (-) and colons (:) to define the span.

   Example:

   ``` md
   | Name       | Age | Gender   |
   |------------|-----|----------|
   | John       | 30  | Male     |
   | Emily      | 25  | Female   |
   | Michael    | 35  | Male     |
   | Sarah      | 28  | Female   |
   |:-----------|-----|:--------:|
   | Total      | 118 |          |
   ```
   
   Explanation:
   
   `:-----------:` The colons on the left of the hyphens indicate centered alignment for the "Name" column. <br>
   `|-----|`: The pipe symbols with hyphens indicate that this cell spans all three columns. <br>
   `| Total | 118 |`: The "Total" cell spans all columns except the "Gender" column. <br>
   
   When rendered, the above example will appear as: <br>

| Name       | Age | Gender   |
|------------|-----|----------|
| John       | 30  | Male     |
| Emily      | 25  | Female   |
| Michael    | 35  | Male     |
| Sarah      | 28  | Female   |
|:-----------|-----|:--------:|
| Total      | 118 |          |
